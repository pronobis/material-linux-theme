material-linux-theme
====================
Auto-generated set of consistent themes for a Linux desktop based on the Android Material color palette. The goal is to easily generate themes for all the apps in your Linux desktop. Currently only a dark theme using Material color palette is implemented.

The theme generator depends on the [python-256](https://github.com/magarcia/python-x256) package.

Themes for the following apps are available at this point:
* GTK 2.0
* GTK 3.0
* i3 window manager
* Emacs
* Midnight Commander
